# Matrix Multiplication Using MPI

## Overview

This program demonstrates how to perform matrix multiplication in parallel using MPI. The program allows the user to input two matrices and distributes the computation of their product among multiple processes. Each process calculates part of the resulting matrix, and the master process gathers and prints the final result.
